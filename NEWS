Changes between 6.x.x and 7.0.0
===============================

Sopel 7.0 contains numerous fixes, tweaks, new features, and internal
improvements. While we maintain no official statistics on such things, it's
probably the biggest release the project has ever seen.

The full, detailed list of changes is below, but you can just read the
[migration guide][sopel-7-migration] if all you care about is the really
important stuff. All breaking changes (including those planned for the *next*
release) are explained there.

Module changes
--------------

* The `spellcheck` module now uses `aspell`, and gained a custom word list
  * Custom word list is managed via a suite of new commands: `.scadd`,
    `.scsave`, `.scpending`, `.scdel`, and `.scclear`) [[#1164][]]
* The `currency` module changed data sources to support more currencies, and
  can optionally use Fixer.io for even *more* [[#1430][], [#1627][], [#1629][]]
  * Fixer.io requires a free API key, which gives plenty of calls per month
    (the module caches exchange rates for 24 hours)
* Choose any of five pastebin services for `help` output [[#1451][], [#1651][]]
  * This is intended mostly for resilience (so one pastebin service going
    down, as ptpb did during the 6.6.x life-cycle, won't force a new Sopel
    release), but it's also just good to have choices
* Optionally hide IRC server name/address in `help` command listing [[#1459][]]
* `wiktionary` now supports many more parts of speech [[#1443][]]
  * Definitions can be retrieved for things like proper nouns, prepositional
    phrases, and punctuation marksâ€”things that were unsupported in Sopel 6.x
  * This means that the `wiktionary` module is now somewhat case-sensitive, to
    account for common and proper nouns that differ only in capitalization
* `url` will now ignore "private" addresses by default [[#1439][], [#1624][]]
  * New config settings for the `url` module allow overriding the checks, in
    cases where loading previews of e.g. LAN servers is safe
  * The default is off, so users don't unwittingly open themselves to attackers
    fishing for running HTTP services on the local machine or network
* Various improvements to the `clock` functions [[#1592][]]
  * Improved guessing in `.t`/`.time` command, which no longer falls back all
    the way to the bot's default timezone if given an unrecognized argument
  * New `.tz` command, to explicitly get time for a timezone name (in case of
    conflict between a known nick and a timezone name)
* The `.at` command (from `remind`) understands dates now [[#1590][]]
  * Finally, it's possible to set a reminder more than 24 hours ahead without
    first converting the future date/time to a duration for use with `.in`!
* Short `redd.it` links are now detected by the `reddit` module [[#1503][]]
* Spoilers & NSFW are now separate concepts in the `reddit` plugin [[#1620][]]
  * Reddit implemented spoilers as a distinct post flag some time ago. Sopel's
    plugin supports independently setting channels as "SFW" or "spoiler-free".
* Rolling `.dice` now officially supports trailing `# comments` [[#1577][]]
* Python version is now included in `.version` command output [[#1462][]]
* The `.version` command's output format is improved [[#1633][]]
* The `.seen` command's output now uses relative time [[#1661][]]
* Readability of `.choose` command output is significantly improved [[#1425][]]
* Added `.invite` command [[#1497][]]
  * Both Sopel and the inviting user must have privileges in the target channel
* A `.restart` command is added [[#1333][]]
  * Usable by admins only, just like `.quit`
* The `.msg` command is now known as `.say` [[#1606][]]
  * `.msg` will continue to work for now, likely until being removed in Sopel 8
* The `admin` module auto-saves channels when using `.join`/`.part`, and added
  `.tmpjoin`/`.tmppart` commands to bypass this behavior [[#1492][]]
* Added command to `.unset` config values in the `admin` module [[#1556][]]
* Restored commands in `adminchannel` module for managing op/voice [[#1498][]]
  * These were removed some time ago, seemingly without reason, by the
    project's previous maintainers
  * Since there was some desire from users to have them back, we restored them
* `find` also collects Sopel's own messages now, so users can "correct" the bot
  if they wish to be extra cheeky [[#1470][]]
* Fixed that the `url` module had to be enabled or some link-handling
  functions didn't work [[#1510][]]
* Fixed `etymology` module error with empty argument [[#1677][]]
* General code cleanup all around [[#1402][], [#1486][], [#1505][], [#1545][],
  [#1569][], [#1573][], [#1578][], [#1579][], [#1581][], [#1592][], [#1606][],
  [#1607][], [#1609][], [#1678][]]

Core changes
------------

* Alternative database types are once again supported [[#1446][], [#1652][]]
  * For details on using non-SQLite databases, see the [README][readme-db] or
    [installation instructions][install-guide-db]
  * You will probably need to install additional dependencies if you wish to
    use something other than SQLite
  * Migrating an existing database from SQLite to your chosen option is
    probably easy, but we do not offer instructions for doing so
* The `db_filename` config setting (for SQLite) is now interpreted as relative
  to the config's `homedir` setting [[#1574][]]
  * `homedir` itself has a default value that will be used if not set
* Added separate server & nickname authentication options [[#1513][]]
  * See [authentication configuration docs][auth-config-docs]
* Log files have become *much* more configurable [[#1678][], [[#1714][]]]
  * Logs are named based on the config name
  * Many, many new settings added to customize logging
  * The default log format includes timestamp, source package, & level (which
    will make logs *much* more useful when reporting bugs)
* Sopel's own rate-limiting & flood protection parameters are now configurable,
  and can even be turned off entirely if Sopel is behind a bouncer or other IRC
  proxy that handles flood protection itself [[#1518][], [#1638][]]
* Log timestamp and log line formats are now configurable [[#1512][]]
  * See details in [the logging configuration docs][logging-config-docs]
* Log filenames now include the config name, to help keep track of logs from
  multiple Sopel instances [[#1547][]]
* Home directory is no longer assumed to be `~/.sopel` on first run [[#1404][]]
* Restarting Sopel via CLI is added [[#1333][]]
* Sopel's CLI is restructured [[#1493][], [#1509][]]
  * New subcommands (`start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `configure`) replace many
    of the old `--option`s, cleaning up the syntax
  * The legacy `--option`s will continue to work for the life of Sopel 7.x, and
    will be removed in Sopel 8
* New `--config-dir` common option [[#1598][]]
* Added a new `sopel-config` command for working with config files [[#1507][]]
  * Currently supports `list` (existing files), `init` (new config file), and
    `get` (config value) actions
  * The old `--list` argument to `sopel` is considered deprecated, and will be
    removed in Sopel 8
  * See detailed usage in your terminal with `sopel-config --help`, or review
    [the online CLI docs][docs-cli-config] at our website
* Added a new `sopel-plugins` command for managing plugins/modules [[#1588][]]
  * Currently supports `list` (available plugins), `show` (plugin details &
    status), `enable` & `disable` (edits config on the user's behalf)
  * See detailed usage in your terminal with `sopel-plugins --help`, or review
    [the online CLI docs][docs-cli-plugins] at our website
* The config file Sopel should use can be specified via the `SOPEL_CONFIG`
  environment variable [[#1473][]]
* List values in config can be separated by newlines [[#1628][], [#1690][]]
  * Newline-separated values support commas within each value
  * Comma-separated value support will end someday, but likely not till Sopel 9
  * Find more details in [the `ListAttribute` documentation][docs-listattr]
* Config options can be set/overridden via environment variables [[#1096][]]
  * Variable naming format: `SOPEL_SECTION_OPTION`
  * Underscores in `SECTION` and `OPTION` names are preserved, e.g.
    `SOPEL_CORE_AUTH_PASSWORD`
* Example service unit files now include a multi-instance template for systemd
  [[#1059][]]
* Example systemd unit files wait until networking is connected before starting
  Sopel [[#1511][]]
* Running Sopel on an unknown OS platform will output a warning encouraging the
  user to report any issues (because test coverage on an unrecognized platform
  name is likely to be nil) [[#1487][]]
* Large amounts of internal refactoring and cleanup [[#1424][], [#1429][],
  [#1456][], [#1458][], [#1472][], [#1479][], [#1510][], [#1522][], [#1527][],
  [#1542][], [#1557][], [#1561][], [#1567][], [#1579][], [#1580][], [#1583][],
  [#1597][], [#1610][], [#1635][], [#1685][], [#1697][], [#1708][]]
* Sopel 7 will emit warnings when run under Python 2, as Python 2.7 has an
  end-of-support date of January 1, 2020 [[#1488][]]
  * While Sopel 7 is intended to remain compatible with Python 2, future
    compatibility is not guaranteed, and users should plan for Sopel 8 to
    officially drop Python 2 support (see [upgrade notes][sopel-7-migration])
* Added support for IRCv3 `echo-message` capability, which Sopel will now
  request upon connecting to an IRC server [[#1470][]]
* Added support for disabling commands (or entire modules) on a per-channel
  basis [[#1235][]]
  * See how it works: [Per-channel configuration][per-channel-conf]
* Fix tracking `away` status of users [[#1663][], [#1664][], [#1703][]]
* User information is now periodically updated [[#1664][]]
* Greatly improved the warning printed when a deprecated function is used,
  adding detail and removing unnecessary traceback lines [[#1568][], [#1613][]]
  * Typical length of output for each deprecated function call reduced from
    roughly 15 lines to 3 (warning, file/line, and offending code snippet)
  * Added optional `@deprecated` decorator arguments:
    * `reason`: why this item was deprecated
    * `version`: the version in which the deprecation happened
    * `removed_in`: the version in which the deprecated item will be removed

API changes
-----------

* [API documentation][api-docs] has been overhauled [[#1563][], [#1566][],
  [#1646][], [#1668][]]
  * More consistent style
  * Better use of Sphinx features (e.g. parameter definitions, return value
    notes, & version annotations)
  * General cleanup and copy-editing
  * Much more detail and examples to help new bot users and plugin authors
* Most of Sopel's submodules now define `__all__`, limiting namespace pollution
  from using `*` in imports [[#1582][]]
* Plugins can register themselves via `setuptools` entry points [[#1585][]]
  * This feature is an evolution of the previous mechanism to install plugins
    via PyPI packages, which required a specific directory structure and
    package name format (`sopel_modules.plugin_name`)
  * See [the entry point plugin documentation][entry-point-plugin] for more
* Logging has been reworked [[#1678][]]
  * The `sopel.logger.get_logger()` function is deprecated in favor of a new
    `sopel.tools.get_logger()` utility with plugin-specific behavior
  * `sopel.logger.get_logger()` will begin emitting deprecation warnings in
    version 8.0, and will be removed in 9.0
* `module.event()` decorator no longer requires a rule to work [[#1693][]]
  * Since 99% (unscientific guesstimate) of event decorators were paired with
    `@module.rule('.*')`, that's now implied if no rule decorator is present
* Added `sopel.tools.web` (replaces `sopel.web`) [[#1616][], [#1670][]]
  * Both old and new import locations will work until Sopel 7 end-of-life
  * The `sopel.web` package will be removed completely in Sopel 8
  * Functions marked as deprecated in the old location (e.g. `web.get()`) do
    *not* carry forward to the new package namespace; they remain deprecated
* Added a set of methods in the `bot` object to manipulate URL callbacks:
  `bot.register_url_callback`, `bot.unregister_url_callback`, and
  `bot.search_url_callbacks` [[#1508][]]
  * Modules should switch to using these new API methods instead of directly
    accessing `bot.memory['url_callbacks']`
  * There are no definite plans to remove `bot.memory['url_callbacks']`, but it
    should be considered deprecated
* Added `kick()` method to `bot` object [[#1539][]]
  * `bot.kick(nick, channel, optional_message)` is shorthand for the pattern
    `bot.write(['KICK', channel, nick], optional_message)`, used by a number
    of both core and third-party plugins
* Added `delete_{nick,channel}_value` methods in `bot.db` [[#1526][]]
* Added "plugin value" API to `bot.db` [[#1621][]]
  * Functionally identical to "nick" and "channel" values, but in a separate
    namespace intended for plugins' use to store key-value data that isn't
    associated with a nick or channel and doesn't belong in the config file
* `sopel.module` decorators work much more consistently [[#1632][]]
  * All relevant decorators accept multiple arguments at once, and will work
    properly if used multiple times on the same function
* `module.require_*()` decorators (all five of them) now accept an optional
  boolean parameter `reply` [[#1456][], [#1500][]]
  * Passing `reply=True` will send the error message as if via `bot.reply()`,
    prefixing it with the name of the calling user to get their attention
  * Passing `reply=False` (or omitting the argument) will behave exactly as
    before, with the error message sent as if via `bot.say()`
* Fixed the `@module.url` decorator to work always, regardless of whether any
  core plugins are enabled [[#1510][], [#1576][]]
* Added `bot.hostmask` property (read-only) [[#1537][]]
  * This property is a shortcut for `bot.users.get(bot.nick).hostmask`, so it
    will throw an error if the bot is not connected to a network **and** joined
    to at least one channel. Basically, don't try to use it in plugin `setup()`
    or `shutdown()` methods.
* Added `module.echo` decorator [[#1470][]]
  * Decorated callables will receive messages that Sopel itself sends,
    regardless of whether the IRC server actually supports `echo-message`
  * Don't send output from `@echo`-decorated callables; this will cause loops
* Added `module.action_commands` decorator [[#1660][]]
  * This presently conflicts with other command/trigger decorators because of
    internal implementation details, but fixing that is on our to-do list
  * If you want both `action_commands` and another command type (`commands`,
    `nickname_commands`, etc.), use `@action_commands('foo')` to decorate a
    wrapper function that simply calls the main one
* Officially deprecated the methods `SopelMemory.contains()` and
  `SopelMemoryWithDefault.contains()`, to be removed in Sopel 8 [[#1563][]]
  * Use the `in` operator instead
* Officially deprecated the `bot.msg()` method [[#1606][]]
  * Adds a warning to Sopel's output for any third-party code that is still
    using `bot.msg()` (which was declared deprecated and removed from the API
    docs in 6.0) instead of `bot.say()`
* Added a new `user_help` kwarg to `@module.example` decorator [[#1403][]]
  * This allows multiple help examples per command, as requested in [#1200][]
  * See the [Sopel 7 migration guide][sopel-7-migration] for details on using
    this new parameter, and about backwards compatibility
* Added a new `online` kwarg to `@module.example` decorator [[#1555][]]
  * Example tests that require an Internet connection may be marked with
    `online=True` to indicate this fact (the default is `False`)
  * This facilitates running only offline-safe module tests, by passing
    `--offline` to pytest, if an Internet connection is unavailable
  * Outside of the test suite, this parameter has no effect
* Added more utilities to `tools.time`:
  * `tools.time.seconds_to_human()`, for generating human-readable fuzzy
    relative timestamps from `timedelta` or raw number of seconds [[#1560][]]
  * `tools.time.get_nick_timezone()` and `tools.time.get_channel_timezone()`,
    for cases where the fallback behavior(s) of `tools.time.get_timezone()`
    would be undesired [[#1592][]]
* Added alias for 462 numeric in `tools.events` [[#1665][]]
  * [RFC 2812][] defined an incorrect spelling, `ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED`, and
    Sopel copied it verbatim
  * The spelling `ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED` can be used now, too
* The `@example` decorator no longer generates invalid raw lines in tests
  [[#1499][]]

[RFC 2812]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812


Changes between 6.6.2 and 6.6.3
===============================

Module changes
--------------

* Fixed loading etymology module on Python 3.3
* Added Unicode support to calc module's `.py` output
* Correctly quote URL parameters in etymology and search modules

Core changes
------------

* Added docstrings to the privilege level constants in `sopel.module`


Changes between 6.6.1 and 6.6.2
===============================

Module changes
--------------

* wiktionary tries harder to get a valid result before erroring out

Core changes
------------

* Fixed an inconsistency between interpretations of the `--config` option in
  normal operation vs. wizard mode
* Requirement specifiers tightened up to reduce/prevent `pip` trying to install
  incompatible dependency versions (`IPython`, `dnspython`)
* SASL token is now split when required according to spec
* Multi-byte Unicode characters are now handled correctly when splitting lines


Changes between 6.6.0 and 6.6.1
===============================

Module changes
--------------

* spellcheck's `pyenchant` dependency is no longer required for py3.7+
  * This should alleviate a lot of installation problems due to `pyenchant`
    being unmaintained. If use of the spellcheck module is desired, the
    necessary libraries may be installed manually.


Changes between 6.5.3 and 6.6.0
===============================

Sopel 6.6.0 has been a long time coming, but it contains a metric ton of fixes
and enhancements. The big stuff is yet to come in Sopel 7, though; stay tuned!
(You can get some hints by browsing the [GitHub milestones][].)

View and contribute toward Sopel's budgetary needs by visiting the project's
new [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/sopel).

Now that Sopel 6.6.0 is released, the focus will shift from preparing the new
release to migrating the website and documentation off of Embolalia's personal
infrastructure. Once this migration is complete, Sopel's [documentation][docs]
will be updated to reflect the changes/additions listed below. Questions about
the new (and old) API methods are welcome in [#sopel][] on Freenode, of course,
as always. Thank you for bearing with this transitional period!

Importantly, a couple of broken modules have been removed in this release. For
easy reference, they and their PyPI-installable replacements are listed near
the top of the "[Module changes](#module-changes)" section.

Because this is the last release planned before Sopel 7, it's important to note
some upcoming changes. They're mostly for module developers, or for bot owners
who run unmaintained third-party modules (which might need manual updating).

But first, a user-facing change. Sopel is drifting toward a more streamlined
release model, which will see most of the core module library split out into
separate packages. Moving modules to their own packages will enable faster
fixes when APIs change, and easier module adoption by members of the community.

Further process details will appear in future changelogs as modules are moved
out of core, but the plan is to have Sopel "require" modules it used to include
for a release or two after their removal. Existing installations should thereby
have a smooth transition, as long as they get updated reasonably often. To
discuss this plan, visit issue [#1291][].

And now, for the developer stuff.

There will be some attention given to how `Identifier` objects work in Sopel 7.
In particular, the way lowercase works appears to have been wrong for some
time. Subscribe to issue [#1389][] for updates, or to join the discussion on
the best plan for addressing this.

Also in Sopel 7, the following deprecated functions in `sopel.web` will be
removed: `get()`, `head()`, `post()`, `get_urllib_object()`. Module authors
should replace these with equivalent code using `requests`. If you don't know
what that is, you're in for a treat: <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>

Remaining `sopel.web` functions might also move in a future major release. See
[#1318][] and comment your opinion if you are a module developer. There is
still plenty of time to give feedback; nothing will happen before Sopel 8 at
the earliest.

Support for multiple help examples on each module command is planned for Sopel
7 and will allow for clearer command and argument documentation. The current
help system uses a deterministic but unintuitive method to choose a single
example to output. The current plan is to make the new multi-example behavior
opt-in, so only help for modules that are explicitly updated to support it will
change. Follow this initiative in [#1200][].

Bot owners and admins might appreciate the new ignore system proposal, which
would (among other things) make "hostmask" blocks actually block hostmasks! See
[#1355][] to participate in the design process; this change is tentatively
planned for Sopel 7 but may be pushed back.

And finally, for users who hate SQLite with a passion: Work on bringing back
alternate DB support has begun! It's unclear how soon this will be ready, but
users who want to switch off SQLite to another database engine might be able to
do so as early as Sopel 7. Follow the ups and downs of this long-awaited
journey at [#1446][] for the time being.

----

Module changes
--------------

* Added emoticons module: includes `.shrug`, `.tableflip`, `.lenny`, and other
  common kaomoji
* Added instagram module: displays information about Instagram links in chat
* Removed movie: The OMDb API went private some time ago (Q2 2017)
  * See [`sopel-modules.imdb`][pypi-imdb] on PyPI for a functional replacement
* Removed weather: Yahoo deprecated its weather service, the last known keyless
  weather API
  * See [`sopel-modules.weather`][pypi-weather] on PyPI for a functional
    replacement that also adds the forecast command originally planned to
    launch with Sopel 6.6.0.
* admin module's `.set` command handles spaces properly now
* bugzilla no longer spits out an error on shutdown if its domain list is empty
* dice module's `.roll`/`.dice`/`.d` command gives friendlier errors, and its
  `.choice`/`.choose`/`.ch` command has cleaner output (will be further
  improved in a later release)
* etymology module updated to work with etymonline.com's changes
* ip module can now look up nicknames (user's hostname) & IPv6 addresses
* ip module switched from deprecated GeoIP database to GeoIP2
* isup module can be forced to ignore untrusted/broken HTTPS with a new command
  alias, `.isupinsecure`
* lmgtfy module gained improved output URLs (HTTPS, encoded query) and help
  examples
* reddit module now picks up links under all commonly used subdomains
* reload's habit of duplicating packaged modules' command output has been
  significantly curtailed
  * There are still some edge cases (like reloading a module with a removed
    function) that might still cause problems, but the majority of module
    updates should be OK now.
  * This feature will continue to improve over the next few releases.
* search module should behave better when encountering Unicode in URLs on py2
* search now warns `.ddg`/`.g` users of a bug affecting multiple "site:"
  operators in a single query
  * This is a bug in DuckDuckGo's plain-HTML SERP, and they have ignored all
    attempts to report it. Sopel's DuckDuckGo code might be rewritten to use an
    unaffected interface in the future.
* tld module gracefully handles missing arguments now
* translate now handles API failures gracefully
* url module can now create a short URL for convenience when fetching title
  * only URLs longer than configured minimum length
  * off by default
* url module will say an error if `.title` command fails
* url module's URL finder will ignore suspicious trailing punctuation, making
  the auto-title feature more reliable when links are included in sentences
* version module no longer prints "wat" to the console/log when answering CTCP
  `VERSION` requests
* wiktionary module now decodes HTML entities in its output before sending, and
  it should also now give correct results for affixes & definitions containing
  reference tags
* xkcd fetching by comic title should work again (switched back-end search
  provider)
* Many modules updated to use HTTPS in both API calls and output

  [pypi-imdb]: https://pypi.org/project/sopel-modules.imdb/
  [pypi-weather]: https://pypi.org/project/sopel-modules.weather/

Core changes
------------

* Added `userserv` option for `auth_method`
* Added default value of `'UTC'` to `default_timezone`
* Added `alias_nicks` option
  * Lets Sopel respond to (a) nickname(s) other than the name it uses for its
    IRC nick
* Made handling `CNAME`'d TLS hostnames more forgiving
* Raw logging is no longer enabled by default
* Comparisons between Identifiers and other types were improved
* Sopel no longer sends the sticky modifier for capabilities
* Database tables are now created using "IF NOT EXISTS" to reduce error
  potential
* Deprecated `sopel.web` calls in various modules updated to use `requests`
  instead
* Intents/CTCP handling fixed
* Fixed more cases where module shutdown routines weren't running

API changes
-----------

* New formatting methods: `italic`, `strikethrough`, `monospace`, `hex_color`,
  `reverse` (inverted video)
  * With the exception of italics, these are all "niche" formatting codes that
    have relatively limited client support, but they are included for
    completeness.
* `sopel.db.get_uri()` was returning an incorrectly formatted result, now fixed
* Fixed populating `bot.channels` privileges dicts on connect
* Fixed updating `User` objects when receiving `NICK` events from the server
* Documentation added/corrected in several places
* Command prefix in examples is now assumed to match the default regex pattern
  (currently `\.`)
  * This fixes some issues with incorrect help output, but might cause new
    problems in modules that use non-standard prefixes in their examples.
  * Sopel's maintenance team regrets not providing advance warning of this
    change, but the potential impact is limited to perhaps a few misplaced
    characters in help output, at mostâ€”same as the bug itself, but likely with
    a much lower incidence.


Changes between 6.5.2 and 6.5.3
===============================

Module changes
--------------

* tell module takes nicknames up to 30 characters long now (previously 20)
* reddit module (and Sopel, by extension) once again accepts any installed
  version of PRAW

Core changes
------------

* Specified which `IPython` versions pip should give Sopel depending on Python
  version in use
* Fixed trying to use `pytest` stuff in production
* Various testing tweaks


Changes between 6.5.1 and 6.5.2
===============================

Larger than the usual "patch" release because it's been so long since the last
version and a number of bugs crept in. New maintainer (dgw) says hi.

To reduce the "dependency hell" of installing things that Sopel doesn't need
unless specific modules are used, the `spellcheck` and `ipython` modules will
likely be removed from core and published separately in a future release
(tentatively, Sopel 7).

----
